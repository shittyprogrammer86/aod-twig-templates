# AOD Twig Templates
Repository for division structure twig templates


### General

This will serve as a collection for the division structure twig templates. Since I don't want to implement a revision history into the tracker to handle this, keeping changes on git makes the most sense.

To get started, review an existing division's structure template to give you an idea of the overall format. You can also look at the documentation below to learn more about syntax. 

Use the tracker editor to compile your template and review the generated bb-code
`https://clanaod.net/v3tracker/divisions/<your-division-abbreviation>/structure/edit`

Once you have a finished template, update your structure here: https://github.com/flashadvocate/aod-twig-templates
